# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Inbox missed-broadcast recovery** (`chats--refresh-inbox` controller): the
  inbox already receives Turbo 8 page *refreshes*, but Action Cable has no
  replay — a refresh broadcast sent while the client's socket was down
  (backgrounded tab/app, network blip) was lost and the inbox sat stale until
  the user navigated. The new controller re-runs the same page refresh on
  cable reconnect and on return-to-visible, extending the thread's
  stale-catch-up doctrine (`docs/campfire_review.md`) to the inbox. It reuses
  the thread's channel-free reconnect detection (observing the
  `<turbo-cable-stream-source>` `connected` attribute), so no new Action Cable
  channel is introduced. Auto-registered via the engine importmap pin; hosts
  need zero changes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-10

Reliability + UX patterns adopted after a deep review of Basecamp's
open-source Campfire (https://github.com/basecamp/once-campfire) — see
`docs/campfire_review.md` for the full adopt/skip ledger:

### Added
- **Telegram-style long-press message actions**: nothing actionable
  renders inline on bubbles anymore. Long-press (or right-click) lifts a
  clone of the bubble to the center over a blurred glass backdrop, with
  the reactions pill above and the contextual menu below (Copy · Edit ·
  Delete in red — plus whatever the host's ejected views inject, e.g. a
  report link). Menu content ships per-bubble as an inert
  `<template data-chats-message-menu>`; `data-chats-own-only` items are
  stripped for foreign messages (cosmetic — the server still authorizes).
- **Composer edit mode**: the long-press Edit closes the popup (the bubble
  morphs back home) and loads the body into the composer under a
  quote-style "Edit message" cue (left accent border, one-line trimmed
  original, ✕ to cancel); the SAME form re-targets to the message's
  update URL with `_method=patch`. The old in-bubble edit form (GET
  `/messages/:id/edit`, `_edit_form`) is REMOVED — update failures now
  render into the composer's error slot. New locale keys:
  `chats.message.copy/.copied`, `chats.composer.editing/.cancel_edit`.
- **Stale-thread catch-up**: `GET /:id/refresh?since=ms` appends messages
  created — and replaces ones edited/tombstoned — while the client was
  asleep; answers deep backlogs with a Turbo 8 page refresh instead of
  splicing. The thread controller calls it when the tab wakes after 60s+
  hidden and whenever the Turbo Stream subscription reconnects (observed
  via turbo-rails' `connected` attribute on the stream source — no extra
  Action Cable channel). Mobile WebViews suspend sockets aggressively;
  without this a backgrounded chat silently loses messages.
- **«New messages» divider**: thread open renders a separator before the
  first unread bubble (computed before `read!` advances the horizon).
  New locale key: `chats.thread.new_messages`.
- **`:conversation_read` notifier event**: fired from `Participant#read!`
  when the horizon actually consumes unread content (`conversation:`,
  `participant:` payload) — lets hosts keep external notification
  surfaces (bells, badges) truthful the moment a thread is read.
- **DOM budget**: the thread caps rendered bubbles (~300) in long live
  sessions, trimming oldest only while parked at the bottom and
  re-planting the keyset pagination anchor so trimmed history stays
  reachable on scroll-up.
- **Chronology guard**: out-of-order broadcast appends (concurrent host
  job workers) are re-slotted into timestamp order client-side.

### Changed
- The recommended `config.notifier` signature is `->(event, **payload)`;
  events now carry different payloads (`:message_created` → `message:`,
  `:conversation_read` → `conversation:, participant:`). Keyword-specific
  lambdas keep working for `:message_created` but log a harmless,
  error-isolated complaint on other events.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09

Initial release. A drop-in, real-time messaging engine for Rails 7.1+ (built for the Rails 8 omakase):

- Direct (1:1) and group conversations, polymorphic participants via `acts_as_messager`
- Conversations attachable to any domain record via `acts_as_chat_subject` (`about:`)
- Real-time everything over Turbo Streams + Action Cable: message append/edit/delete, Turbo 8 inbox refreshes, live unread badges, typing indicators (custom stream action), read receipts ("Seen")
- Read state as a per-participant horizon (no per-message receipts table)
- Race-safe direct-conversation identity (`direct_key` + `create_or_find_by!`)
- Image/any attachments (ActiveStorage), emoji reactions, message editing, soft-delete tombstones, system messages (`post_system_message!`)
- Inbox with search, previews, unread counts; keyset-paginated infinite scroll-up
- Block enforcement seam (`blocked_messager_ids`) hardcoded beneath the `can_message` policy; full duck-typed reportable contract for the `moderate` gem
- Notifier hook (`config.notifier`) + notification-etiquette helpers (`notifiable_for?`, `should_notify?`, `mark_notified!`)
- Per-sender rate limiting (Rails 8 `rate_limit`, feature-detected), optional encryption at rest
- Adaptive install generator (uuid/bigint primary keys; postgres/mysql/sqlite JSON handling), Devise-style views ejector
- Two self-registering Stimulus controllers (importmap pins under `controllers/chats/*`), bundled CSS-variable-themed stylesheet, `en`/`es` locales
