## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09

Initial release. A drop-in, real-time messaging engine for Rails 7.1+ (built for the Rails 8 omakase):

- Direct (1:1) and group conversations, polymorphic participants via `acts_as_messager`
- Conversations attachable to any domain record via `acts_as_chat_subject` (`about:`)
- Real-time everything over Turbo Streams + Action Cable: message append/edit/delete, Turbo 8 inbox refreshes, live unread badges, typing indicators (custom stream action), read receipts ("Seen")
- Read state as a per-participant horizon (no per-message receipts table)
- Race-safe direct-conversation identity (`direct_key` + `create_or_find_by!`)
- Image/any attachments (ActiveStorage), emoji reactions, message editing, soft-delete tombstones, system messages (`post_system_message!`)
- Inbox with search, previews, unread counts; keyset-paginated infinite scroll-up
- Block enforcement seam (`blocked_messager_ids`) hardcoded beneath the `can_message` policy; full duck-typed reportable contract for the `moderate` gem
- Notifier hook (`config.notifier`) + notification-etiquette helpers (`notifiable_for?`, `should_notify?`, `mark_notified!`)
- Per-sender rate limiting (Rails 8 `rate_limit`, feature-detected), optional encryption at rest
- Adaptive install generator (uuid/bigint primary keys; postgres/mysql/sqlite JSON handling), Devise-style views ejector
- Two self-registering Stimulus controllers (importmap pins under `controllers/chats/*`), bundled CSS-variable-themed stylesheet, `en`/`es` locales
